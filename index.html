				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I was born in New York City and have spent much of my career up until now following my passion in wildlife conservation and eco-tourism. My favorite animal is the clouded leopard, pictured below, and I hope to one day travel to Southeast Asia and try to see one in the wild. In addition to my love for animals and ecology I am also a rabid team sports fan, supporting most New York based clubs in addition to Borussia Dortmund for European football.</p>
