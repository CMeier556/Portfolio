				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I was born in New York City and have spent much of my career up until now following my passion in wildlife conservation and eco-tourism. My favorite animal is the clouded leopard, pictured below, and I hope to one day travel to Southeast Asia and try to see one in the wild. In addition to my love for animals and ecology I am also a rabid team sports fan, supporting most New York based clubs in addition to Borussia Dortmund for European football.</p>

				<h3>Project Management API</h3>
				<p>This is an API my team and I have built using PHP that interacts with a front-end project-management software. I held several roles including writing queries and fetch requests for getting specific projects and the tasks assigned to each member of the project, in addition to error handling when the requests contain invalid data.</p>

				<h3>React Email Client</h3>
				<p>This is a JavaScript email client I built using component-based development with React. The front-end was built using Bootstrap and retrieves and validates email data from an API, with functionality for sending an email and organizing emails based on read and unread.</p>
