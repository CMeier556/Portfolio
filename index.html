			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p class="info">I was born in New York City and have spent much of my career up until now following my passion in wildlife conservation and eco-tourism. In addition to my love for animals and ecology I am also a rabid sports fan, supporting most New York based clubs in addition to Borussia Dortmund for European football.</p>
